'''
I want to have multi TF correlation values but I can't use HTFs like D1
when Im filling a historical db. If I did I'd end up with choppy value
lines since I'd only get a single D1 value per day.  So to emulate real historical 
data Im going to use M5 candles but multiply all applicable values (correlation period,
look backs).  

The symbols I scan for correlation have various market open hours.  In order to normalize 
the correlation values between markets that have different hours than the FX pairs, I first
scan for corr using only the rows where each market is open.  However, ultimately I want to
use all the corr that's found in order to plot a single "value" line overlayed on a FX major
ohlc chart.  To have data consistently disappear in the overnight session leads to a lot of
choppiness in that line.  So after the correlation values are found, I reindex the corr data
to add in the overnight session and I just do a 'ffill' on the nans.
